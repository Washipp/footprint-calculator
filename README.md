# FootprintCalculator

This Project was created for our course at [ETHZ](https://www.ethz.ch). 
Namely "Energy, Resources, Environment: Risks and Prospects".

The final tool lets you calculate your Carbon-Footprint while using Zoom.
While it is focused on ETHZ students, anyone can use this tool.

A demo is not yet available.
